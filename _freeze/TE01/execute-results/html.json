At Vietnam National University (VNU) Hanoi, understanding factors influencing GPA carries direct implications for curriculum design, student support services, and resource allocation.\n\nThis analysis examines factors influencing academic performance (measured by GPA) among 2,170 students and alumni from the University of Education, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, using a data set collected via online surveys from March to June 2023. The study highlights demographic traits, behavioral habits like study time and social media use, and institutional/peer support as key drivers of learning outcomes, with most students reporting over 8 hours of daily study and moderate social media engagement.\n\n# Installing and Loading Required Libraries\n\nGetting the right tools ready is key before any data dive. Here, R with tidyverse and ggplot2 handled everything from loading the dataset to crafting those clean stacked bar visuals.\n\nEssential libraries loaded include:\n\n-   [**tidyverse**](https://tidyverse.org/packages/): A collection of R packages designed for data science. It includes core packages like **dplyr**, **tidyr**, **readr**, and **ggplot2**.\n\n-   [**readxl**](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/): This package is specifically designed to import tabular data from Excel files (.xls and .xlsx) into R. While it is part of the broader tidyverse ecosystem, it is not loaded automatically and must be called separately.\n\n-   [**patchwork**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/patchwork/index.html): This package is used for plot composition, which helps to combine separate ggplot2 objects into a single graphic.\n\nThe code chunk below is used for loading the required packages:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, readxl, patchwork)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Importing and Preparing the Data\n\nTo analyse and visualize the factors that affect the learning outcomes of university students, The VNU Hanoi student survey data set found in the Mendeley repository was used, which can be found [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/23ppcdbmhc/1/files/9c0728d7-e79b-40e1-a3a7-4e1642de1d8d).\n\nThe data was imported as an Excel file using `read_xlsx()` from **readxl**, containing variables like demographics (gender, year, parental background), behavioral factors (study time, social media use, time with friends), and institutional support metrics.\n\nTo verify that the complete data set was loaded, `dim(df)` was used to find its dimension, which confirmed that there are 2,170 rows and 22 columns. No missing values were detected `(sum(is.na(df)) == 0)`, confirming complete responses. All variables arrived as numeric doubles representing ordinal categories per the [codebook](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/23ppcdbmhc/1/files/744c66a1-04f8-4229-86cd-154664b5550d) provided.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Importing the dataset\ndf <- read_xlsx(\"data/VNU Students Data.xlsx\")\n\n#Viewing the data\ndim(df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2170   22\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nshow(df[1:10,1:5])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n    Year Gender Policy_Stu Minority_Stu Poor_Stu\n   <dbl>  <dbl>      <dbl>        <dbl>    <dbl>\n 1     5      2          2            2        2\n 2     5      1          2            2        2\n 3     5      2          2            2        2\n 4     5      2          2            2        2\n 5     5      1          1            2        2\n 6     5      2          2            2        2\n 7     5      2          2            2        2\n 8     5      2          2            2        2\n 9     5      2          2            2        2\n10     5      2          2            2        2\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Check for missing values\nsum(is.na(df))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nData preprocessing involved converting numeric codes to labeled factors using `dplyr::mutate()`.

This range represents the most effective balance for top-tier results.\n\n-   Studying more than 8 hours does not lead to better outcomes. In fact, \"Excellent\" scores decrease in this bracket, suggesting that excessive study may lead to burnout or reduced focus.\n\n-   Studying fewer than 4 hours is strongly linked to \"Average\" and \"Poor\" GPAs, indicating a minimum threshold is necessary for stability.\n\n-   The \"Fair\" GPA category (2.5–3.2) remains the most common outcome across all study levels.\n\nMaximum academic success is most frequently reached at **4–6 hours** of study; both insufficient and excessive effort yield lower proportions of top grades.\n\n# Impact of Social Media Engagement on GPA\n\nSocial media is everywhere, but does scrolling hurt grades?

The \"Excellent\" (Over 3.6) category also remains consistently small across all usage levels.\n\n-   As social media usage exceeds 4 hours, there is a visible increase in the proportion of students with \"Poor\" (Under 2.0) and \"Average\" (2.0–2.5) GPAs, represented by the dark blue and purple segments.\n\n-   Across most time increments, the \"Fair\" (2.5–3.2) GPA category remains the largest demographic, though it narrows slightly as social media time increases.\n\nWhile **moderate use (1–4 hours)** shows **relatively stable GPA** distributions, **heavy usage (4+ hours)** is clearly associated with a higher likelihood of **lower grades** and a decrease in top-tier academic results.\n\n# Social Interaction and Academic Outcomes\n\nWhat about hanging out with friends?

Across all time periods, the vast majority of students fall within the **\"Fair\" (2.5-3.2 GPA)** category, represented by the large pink sections.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n-   The proportion of \"Excellent\" students (over 3.6 GPA) remains consistently low (under 10%) across all groups, though it appears slightly higher for those spending 3-4 hours with friends compared to other groups.\n\n-   Students spending more than 3 hours with friends show a slightly larger proportion of \"Poor\" (under 2.0) and \"Average\" (2.0-2.5) GPAs compared to those who socialize less.\n\nOverall, the plot suggests that **moderate to high levels of socialization** do not drastically shift the overall distribution of GPA scores for most students.\n\n# Peer Influence and Collaborative Learning\n\nPeers shape motivation, from competition to group hangs.

However, this proportion is noticeably higher for those in the \"Yes\" status groups, indicating a concentration in the middle-to-lower performance tiers.\n\n-   The \"No\" status groups consistently exhibit larger yellow segments, suggesting that students from more advantaged backgrounds are more likely to achieve an **\"Excellent\"** GPA (over 3.6).\n\n-   While the proportions of **\"Poor\"** and **\"Average\"** GPAs (dark purple/blue) are relatively small overall, they appear slightly more prominent in the \"Yes\" status columns.\n\nOverall, the data suggests that **socioeconomic challenges** correlate with a lower probability of achieving top-tier academic results, with disadvantaged students more likely to cluster in the \"Fair\" GPA range.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis analysis indicates that academic performance is influenced by a combination of study habits, social interaction, and environmental factors, though several data biases must be considered.\n\n-   **Optimal Study-Life Balance:** The data suggests a \"sweet spot\" for academic success, with peak performance reached at **4–6 hours of study**. Conversely, heavy usage of other activities (4+ hours) and excessive socialization (3+ hours) are linked to a higher frequency of lower GPAs.\n\n-   **The Role of Competition:** A competitive classroom environment appears to be a significant driver of high achievement. The \"Excellent\" GPA category only becomes a visible segment as class competitiveness increases from \"Moderate\" to \"Very\" high.\n\n-   **Socialization Trends:** While moderate socialization does not drastically shift overall GPA distributions, those who spend 3–4 hours with friends surprisingly show a slightly higher proportion of \"Excellent\" grades compared to other groups, despite also seeing an increase in \"Poor\" grades.\n\n-   **Data Limitations and Bias:** It is critical to note that these findings may be skewed by a **gender imbalance** (more female respondents) and a **lack of representation** from first- and second-year students. Furthermore, a large portion of the respondents have already graduated, which may affect the current relevance of the trends.\n\n# References\n\n-   Kam, T.S. (2023).
